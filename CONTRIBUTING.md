# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in improving the GenAI Model Deployment Checklist!  
At this time, the checklist is in an early stage and is **not being actively maintained**, but we welcome your feedback and suggestions for future updates.

- If you have ideas for new checklist items, improvements, or corrections, please **open an issue** to start a discussion.
- While we are not yet accepting pull requests for major changes, simple fixes or documentation tweaks are welcome.
- You may also share real-world use cases to inform future versions.

We plan to develop more comprehensive contribution guidelines as the project matures.  
In the meantime, your input via issues will help shape the future direction of this checklist.

**Thank you for understanding, and we look forward to your feedback!**
