A community-driven guide to preparing GenAI models—including LLMs, diffusion models, embedding services, and multimodal pipelines—for production deployment.
As AI systems grow more capable and more computationally intensive, deploying models reliably has become one of the hardest operational challenges for engineering teams. Unlike microservices, GenAI workloads have unique characteristics—batching behavior, memory spikes, warmup cycles, model-specific latency curves, GPU constraints—that require their own deployment discipline.

This repository provides a structured checklist to help teams ensure their models are:
- performant
- reliable
- observable
- cost-efficient
- safe
- production-ready

This checklist is model-type agnostic and applies to:
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Diffusion and image generation models
- Embedding and retrieval pipelines
- Multimodal models
- Audio, vision, and generative pipelines
